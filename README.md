# AKAI Recruitment ðŸ“±

My name is Maciej NiedÅºwiecki. I am a student of the Poznan University of Technology in the field of Electronics and Telecommunications. I started learning frontend technologies this summer vacation and I enjoyed it a lot.

Here is my solution to the AKAI recruitment task. I would like to develop my frontend skills at the science club. That's why I decided to apply. I am new to the community and I would like to gain the necessary practice experience.

That was the first time when I have used javascript in my project. It wasn't as bad as I imagined. I read a few articles and tried to handle it. Now I am going to complete my javascript course to create better projects in the future.
